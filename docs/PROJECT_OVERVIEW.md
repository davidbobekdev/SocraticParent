# Project Overview: Socratic Parent
**Theme:** The "Anti-Homework-Solver" for the 2026 AI-Saturated Era.

## 1. The Problem (2026 Context)
In 2026, AI "solvers" are ubiquitous. Students can point a camera at any problem and get an answer in 0.5 seconds. This has led to "Knowledge Decay." Parents want to help, but they are often disconnected from modern curricula or lack the pedagogical training to guide without giving the answer.

## 2. The Solution
Socratic Parent acts as a **Pedagogical Firewall**. It uses multimodal AI to read the homework and provides the parent with a structured "Think-Aloud" script. It turns a potential 10-minute cheating session into a 20-minute meaningful learning moment between parent and child.

## 3. Competitive Moat
Most EdTech tools sell "Answers." We sell "Mastery."
- **COPPA Ready:** Privacy-first design, locally processed where possible.
- **Cognitive Load Optimization:** Scripts are tailored to the student's visible struggle, not just the subject matter.
- **Relational Tool:** It transforms homework from a source of conflict into a source of connection.
