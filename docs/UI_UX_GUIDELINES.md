# UI/UX & Design Language

## 1. The "Friction" Philosophy
In this app, "fast" is not always better. The UI should encourage the parent to slow down and read the script before speaking to the child.
- **Visual Pace:** Use subtle animations that reveal questions one by one.

## 2. Design Tokens
- **Primary Color:** #4F46E5 (Deep Indigo - Trust)
- **Secondary Color:** #10B981 (Success Green - Growth)
- **Background:** #F9FAFB (Clean White/Gray)

## 3. Component States
- **Empty State:** "Waiting for your child's genius..."
- **Error State:** "The lighting is a bit low. Let's get a clearer view of that math!"
- **Result State:** Large, clear text meant to be read from a 2-foot distance (phone on a table).
